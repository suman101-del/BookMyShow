# BookMyShow
I have designed a BookMyShow application using Spring Boot and a Microservices architecture. 
The application consists of two primary microservices: a Notification Server and a Payment Server. 
The Notification Server is responsible for sending booking confirmations and reminders via email or SMS to users. 
The Payment Server handles secure payment processing, ensuring transactions are completed seamlessly. 
This architecture allows the system to be modular, scalable, and highly efficient, making it suitable for real-world ticket booking operations.
Integration and testing were performed using tools like Postman, ensuring robust functionality and user satisfaction.
